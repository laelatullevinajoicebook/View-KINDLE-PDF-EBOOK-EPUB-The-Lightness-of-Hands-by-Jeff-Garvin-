The Lightness of Hands by Jeff Garvin Book Review

Name: West Coast Don
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Muchmorethanayoungadultnovel
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2020
Review: It was three years ago when I read a draft of Jeff Garvin‚Äôs second novel, Lightness of Hands. At that time, the book was still not titled and I was forbidden to reveal anything about the content. But, the book was published this month (4/20) by Balzer & Broy, a subsidiary of HarperCollins. This is a young adult adventure story in the world of Magic, from sleight of hand magic to grand illusions. Also, the story is imbedded in issues of mental health.Jeff Garvin has written a compelling novel about a 16-year-old girl, Ellie Dante and her father, the Uncanny Dante. They are down and out because 10 years before, he had failed in the midst of a televised grand illusion in which he was supposed to escape from a truck which was fully underwater. He failed, had to be rescued, and nearly died. The story of this failure made national news. Then, Ellie‚Äôs mother committed suicide. So, this story was a father-daughter adventure. But performing magic was the only way her dad knew how or was willing to earn money. So, dad and daughter traveled the country in an old and beat up RV taking whatever birthday parties or similar events where they could earn some survival money.Sometimes, they paid for their next meals by lifting wallets. About the time Ellie and her dad were going to spend their last dollars, Ellie took a call from a magic team that had been on a long successful run in Vegas, and they wanted to do a show involving former magic performers, a sort of vintage magic show, and they wanted Ellies dad to have another try at the illusion that nearly killed him. They figured that if he succeeded, or if he failed again, that it would be good for their ratings. This was a trick that dad had not attempted since the big failure. Ellie accepted the offer without telling her father, and then she had to get him to Los Angeles without telling him why they were going there.The author Garvin, filled out this story with a variety of cast members from Ellie‚Äôs life and from her father‚Äôs life, as well inventing some other particular interesting characters. This book is a winner, and I could not put it down. This one may be published as a young adult novel, but it is a very rich story that is also suitable for older adults. Garvin is a gifted story teller. The novel gets my highest recommendation.

Review: Jeff Garvin did not disappoint in his second release. It's a beautiful story with everything you've ever needed in a young adult narrative. Mental Health as priority. Setting at its most palpable. Magic and LAs Vegas heat.Wonderful book.

Review: This book is so great for so many reasons. I'm a HUGE fan of Garvin's first novel (Symptoms of Being Human, which is a book I recommend all the time and think should be on every reading list) so I've been looking forward to The Lightness of Hands... and it doesn't disappoint! Garvin writes with such an authentic and compelling voice that it's easy to read quickly without realizing how incredibly well-crafted his writing is... and on top of that, he writes about tough subjects with such a light and relatable touch. I think my favorite thing about a Jeff Garvin book is that he's master of the best friend novel (If you loved Riley and Solo's friendship in Symptoms of Being Human, you're going to love Ripley and Ellie)! Can't recommend this enough - one of my favorite authors writing today.

Review: Magic, ambition, failure, hope, giving your hopes and your troubles to the next generation.The author says he didn't set out to write about mental illness, but it is a better book for including this, it is fact integral to the plot to have it, and important to normalize mental illness as something that can happen to anyone.Lots of flirting but romance is not the most important part of the story.This is a wonderful book

Title: Bildungsromanwithatwist
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2020
Review: A road trip adventure, teenage fantasy, bildungsroman - all in one. The main character, Ellie, struggles with bipolar disorder, while caring for her ageing father, a traveling magician whose seen better days. As it turns out, challenges are opportunities, and it is this very struggle that helps Ellie come to terms with life's big questions about meaning and the concept of self. Elie's ups and down are palpable. Her questions about how emotions and actions inform our sense of being are universal. As the book is written as a first-person perspective from Ellies point of view, there are many time when it feels as one gets a front seat to one's mind theater playing bipolar.It is not a small feat to add raw mental illness to the already explosive background of teenage years while maintaining clarity and legerdemain. Through it all, Garwin's narrative is compelling, emphatic, and compassionate. Highly recommended.

Review: Jeff Garvin has weaved together the perfect story. Part road trip. Part mental health experience. Part father-daughter relationship. Part romance. Part supportive best friend. Part pick pocketing. Part broken down RVs. Part hotel rooms. Part hospital rooms. Part dark roads at night. Part bright lights of the Las Vegas strip. Part salty. Part sweet. Part magic. All magical. I‚Äôm so grateful this book exists. It‚Äôs one of my favorite reads of 2020.

Review: I bought this book when it first came out, as I was a fan of Symptoms of Being Human, but only now got to reading the. As an educator, I was drawn in by the narrator's descriptions of her experience with bipolar disorder. This book has a serious message to share about self-care, and that "life with bipolar is a life worth living". I'm grateful that any and every student I've had who has been touched by bipolar has a story now in which they may feel seen. If you're a fan of literature, here is your bildungsroman. Here is your hero's journey. Enjoy this adventure.

Review: Jeff Garvin has a serious talent for making characters feel very real. I was immediately sympathetic for Ellie's many stressors - living with Bipolar II, worrying about her father's health, living life on the road with their funds quickly diminishing...And rooting for her so much as she tries to turn their lives around.This novel will appeal to so many of my teen readers - a road trip story, a great cast of characters, and a terrific ending.I can't wait to see what Garvin writes next. If you haven't read The Symptoms of Being Human add that to your list as well!
